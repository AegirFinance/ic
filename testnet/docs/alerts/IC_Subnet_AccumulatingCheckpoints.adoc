== Triggered by

A replica reports that there are more checkpoints than expected 
(> 3) stored on disk for 5 minutes.

== Impact

If checkpoints keep accumulating the disk will eventually fill up.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

* A bug in the replica that prevents cleaning up checkpoints.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

* Inform the Message Routing team (at
  https://dfinity.slack.com/archives/CKXPC1928[`#eng-messaging`] or via
  `@team-messaging`) to start investigating the root cause and find a
  permanent solution.
